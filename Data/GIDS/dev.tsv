James graduated from the University_of_Pennsylvania in 1891 and later earned a degree of Mining Engineering from Towne Scientific School in 1892.

Their names were Stewart and Jim, both had benevolent faces and handlebar moustaches, and, at parties, chewed on their cigars and listened to their wives... ''Jim of course never speaks if he can help it...speaking is against his principles``... ''Jim actually interrupts! `` But his little flare of rebellion was quickly extinguished and I remember only his good-natured silences while Aunt Sarah's tongue reeled out like a string with a colourful kite dancing at the end. ###END### 	1

The court in that case held that Maynard's judicial acts were valid based on the presumption that his acceptance of the Supreme Court appointment constituted a resignation of his congressional office, and that it was up to Congress to address his continued occupation of that office. ###END### 	1

/m/0fpgx_7	/m/031y2	Emilio_De_Fabris	Florence	/people/person/place_of_birth	Emilio_De_Fabris was born 1808 in Florence , Italy. Fabris was an architect most famous for his design of the west facade of the Santa Maria del Fiore. The original facade design by Giotto was found outdated for the cathedral and so a series of three competitions were held to modify Giotto's original design, keeping with the main lines of the structure. The challenge for the competition was to create a facade which brought together two periods in architecture: the Gothic style, which had faded out, and the Renaissance style, which was more recent. In 1871, Fabris' design won, and he immediately went to work embellishing the cathedral with red, green, and white marble. Florence was extremely proud of De Fabris' devotion of his time and energy to make this a truly monumental landmark of the city. Fabris died in 1883. ###END### 	1
